# Task-Manager
Task Manager In Reactjs
 Task Manager is a React-based task management app designed to help users efficiently organize, prioritize, and track their tasks. The app supports adding new tasks, setting priorities, sorting, filtering by title and priority, and marking tasks as completed. The priority levels are color-coded to provide quick visual cues, and the app also persists data in the browserâ€™s localStorage so tasks remain available after a page refresh.

Features
Add Tasks: Create new tasks with a specified priority level (Low, Medium, High).
Search & Filter: Search tasks by title and filter based on priority.
Sort: Sort tasks by title or priority.
Completion Toggle: Mark tasks as completed, with completed tasks displayed with reduced opacity.
Persistent Storage: Task data is stored in localStorage to retain state across browser sessions.
Dynamic Priority Update: Change the priority of any task from the task list.

Assumptions
Task Structure: Each task is assumed to have a title, a completion status, and a priority level.
Task ID: The Date.now() function is used for generating unique IDs for each task.
Sorting Criteria: Sorting by title is alphabetical, and sorting by priority is based on an assigned value for each priority (High > Medium > Low).
UI Components: The design assumes access to UI components such as Input, Button, Card, and Checkbox, imported from custom modules or a component library.
